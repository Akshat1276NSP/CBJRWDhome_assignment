                  origin, and contains essential nutrients, such as carbohydrates, fats, proteins, vitamins, or minerals. The substance is<br>

                  Protection, World Resources Institute, World Food Programme, Food and Agriculture Organization, and International<br>
                  Food Information Council. They address issues such as sustainability, biological diversity, climate change, nutritional<br>
                  economics, population growth, water supply, and access to food.</h4>
