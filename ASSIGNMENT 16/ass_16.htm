    <p><i>This is about Shinchan</i></p>
    <p>Crayon-Shin chan (Japanese: クレヨンしんちゃん, Hepburn: Kureyon Shin-chan), also known as Shin Chan, is a Japanese manga series written and illustrated by Yoshito Usui. It follows the adventures of the five-year-old Shinnosuke "Shin" Nohara and his parents, baby sister, dog, neighbours, and friends and is set in Kasukabe, Saitama Prefecture of Japan. </p>
    <p class="two"><b>Crayon Shin-chan first appeared in 1990 in a Japanese weekly magazine called Weekly Manga Action, which was published by Futabasha. Due to the death of author Yoshito Usui, the manga in its original form ended on September 11, 2009. A new manga began in the summer of 2010 by members of Usui's team, titled New Crayon Shin-chan (新クレヨンしんちゃん, Shin Kureyon Shin-chan).</b></p>
    <h3>IMPORTANT FACT:</h3>
    <p class="three">An anime spin-off titled Super Shiro, produced by Science Saru, premiered in October 2019. The story follows the Noharas' family dog, Shiro, becoming a superhero and protecting the legendary bone "Bobobobobone" from the evil inventor dog, Dekapoo and his ambitions of world domination.</p>
    <p class="one"><i>A Ministry spokesperson explained the novel decision as an attempt to help people in other countries understand Japanese anime better and to deepen their interest in Japanese culture.</i></p>
    <p>A total of 1,465 stories were created in the original series, which are published by Shogakukan. It is the best-selling manga for children and one of the best-selling manga in the world, and has sold over 100 million copies as of 2015.</p>
